OnSite Timekeeper is the simplest way to track your work hours on construction sites and job locations.

★ MANUAL TIME ENTRY
Log your daily entry and exit times with just a few taps. Track breaks, select your job site, and save. It's as simple as writing on a notepad — but smarter.

★ AUTOMATIC GEOFENCING
Create a virtual boundary around your work site. When you arrive, the app automatically starts tracking. When you leave, it logs your exit time. No more forgetting to clock in.

★ VOICE COMMANDS
Tap the microphone and say what you need: "Log 8 hours today", "Start timer", "Send my weekly report". The AI assistant understands natural language in English and Portuguese.

★ CALENDAR & REPORTS
See all your work days on a clean monthly calendar. Tap any day to see the full breakdown. Export professional PDF timesheets for payroll or invoicing.

★ MULTIPLE JOB SITES
Managing different locations? Create color-coded geofences for each site. The app knows which site you're at and logs accordingly.

★ OFFLINE FIRST
Your data is stored locally on your device. It syncs securely to the cloud when you're online. You're never blocked by poor connectivity on a job site.

★ PRIVACY FOCUSED
GPS data is used exclusively for geofencing and is never sold or shared with advertisers. You can delete all your data at any time.

Perfect for: construction workers, contractors, freelancers, field technicians, maintenance crews, and anyone who needs proof of their work hours.
