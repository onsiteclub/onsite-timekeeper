OnSite Timekeeper is the easiest way to track your work hours on construction sites and job locations.

SIMPLE TIME TRACKING
• Log your daily hours with just a few taps
• Set entry and exit times manually
• Track break time separately
• View your work history on a clean calendar
• Export professional PDF timesheets

AUTOMATIC GEOFENCING
• Create geofence zones around your job sites
• The app automatically detects when you arrive and leave
• No more forgetting to clock in or out
• Works in the background — even when your phone is locked
• Battery-efficient region monitoring (not constant GPS tracking)

VOICE COMMANDS
• Tap the microphone button to speak commands
• "Log 8 hours today" — done in seconds
• "Start timer" / "Stop timer" — hands-free control
• Works in English and Portuguese
• AI-powered natural language understanding

REPORTS & EXPORT
• Monthly calendar view with daily summaries
• Detailed breakdown per day (entry, exit, breaks, total)
• Export to PDF for payroll or invoicing
• Share reports via email or messaging apps

MULTIPLE JOB SITES
• Track hours across different locations
• Color-coded sites for easy identification
• Map view to manage all your geofences

PRIVACY FIRST
• Your data stays on your device (offline-first)
• Syncs securely when online
• GPS data used only for geofencing — never sold or shared
• Delete your data anytime

Built for construction workers, contractors, freelancers, and anyone who needs reliable proof of their work hours.
