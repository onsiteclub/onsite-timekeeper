=== 1. BACKGROUND LOCATION (Play Console > App Content > Sensitive permissions) ===

Tipo: Geofencing

Justificativa (colar no formulario):
OnSite Timekeeper is a workforce time-tracking app for construction workers.
It uses background location exclusively for geofencing — automatically detecting
when users arrive at or leave registered work sites. Background location access
is essential because workers arrive at job sites with the app closed or in the
background. Without background location, the app cannot detect arrival/departure
events, which is the core functionality. We use region monitoring (geofencing),
not continuous GPS tracking. Location data is never shared with third parties
or used for advertising.

=== 2. REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS (Play Console > Restricted permissions) ===

Justificativa (colar no formulario):
OnSite Timekeeper requires exemption from battery optimization because its core
feature — geofence-based automatic time tracking — depends on receiving location
events when the app is in the background. Without this exemption, the Android OS
may kill the geofence monitoring service, causing missed clock-in/clock-out events
for construction workers.

=== 3. DATA SAFETY FORM (Play Console > App Content > Data safety) ===
