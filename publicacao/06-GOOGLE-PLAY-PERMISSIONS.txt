GOOGLE PLAY — PERMISSOES E FORMULARIOS
Cole nos formularios do Google Play Console
============================================

=== 1. BACKGROUND LOCATION (Play Console > App Content > Sensitive permissions) ===

Tipo: Geofencing

Justificativa (colar no formulario):
OnSite Timekeeper is a workforce time-tracking app for construction workers.
It uses background location exclusively for geofencing — automatically detecting
when users arrive at or leave registered work sites. Background location access
is essential because workers arrive at job sites with the app closed or in the
background. Without background location, the app cannot detect arrival/departure
events, which is the core functionality. We use region monitoring (geofencing),
not continuous GPS tracking. Location data is never shared with third parties
or used for advertising.

=== 2. REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS (Play Console > Restricted permissions) ===

Justificativa (colar no formulario):
OnSite Timekeeper requires exemption from battery optimization because its core
feature — geofence-based automatic time tracking — depends on receiving location
events when the app is in the background. Without this exemption, the Android OS
may kill the geofence monitoring service, causing missed clock-in/clock-out events
for construction workers.

=== 3. FOREGROUND SERVICE — LOCATION (Play Console > App Content > Sensitive permissions) ===

Obrigatorio desde maio 2024 para targetSdkVersion 35+.
Formulario SEPARADO do background location.

Justificativa (colar no formulario):
OnSite Timekeeper uses a foreground service with location type to maintain
reliable geofence monitoring while the user is actively tracked at a work site.
When a worker arrives at a registered job site, the app switches to active
tracking mode to ensure accurate entry/exit detection. The foreground service
displays a persistent notification ("Tracking work hours") so the user is always
aware that location monitoring is active. Without the foreground service, Android
may terminate the geofence monitoring process, causing missed clock-out events
and inaccurate work hour records.

Video: regravar o mesmo video do background location mostrando:
1. Prominent disclosure modal
2. Permissao do OS concedida
3. Notificacao persistente aparecendo ("OnSite Timekeeper - Tracking work hours")
4. Geofence entry/exit sendo detectado

=== 4. RECORD_AUDIO (Play Console > App Content > Sensitive permissions) ===

Justificativa (colar no formulario):
OnSite Timekeeper offers an optional voice command feature that allows
construction workers to log work hours hands-free by speaking. The microphone
is activated only when the user explicitly taps a microphone button. Audio is
sent to a secure server (OpenAI Whisper) for speech-to-text transcription and
is immediately deleted after processing — no audio is stored on our servers or
on the device. The microphone is never activated in the background or without
user action.

Video (se solicitado):
1. Abrir o app na Home tab
2. Tocar no botao de microfone
3. Falar um comando ("I worked 8 hours today")
4. Mostrar o resultado sendo aplicado
