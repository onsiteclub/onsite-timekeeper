PRIVACY POLICY — OnSite Timekeeper
Last updated: February 17, 2026
Effective date: February 17, 2026

OnSite Club ("we", "our", "us") operates the OnSite Timekeeper mobile application
(the "App"). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, and protect
your information.

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information as described
in this policy.

1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

1.1 Account Information
When you create an account, we collect your email address and password (encrypted).
This is required for authentication and data synchronization.

1.2 Location Data
The App collects precise GPS coordinates for the following purposes:
- Geofencing: Detecting when you arrive at or leave a registered work site
- Map display: Showing your position on the in-app map
- Audit trail: Recording entry/exit coordinates as proof of attendance

Location data is collected in the background when you have active geofences
configured. You can disable background location at any time in your device settings.

1.3 Audio Data
When you use the voice command feature, the App temporarily records audio through
your device microphone. This audio is:
- Sent to our secure backend server for processing
- Forwarded to OpenAI's Whisper API for speech-to-text transcription
- Deleted immediately after transcription — audio is NEVER stored permanently
- The resulting text transcript is processed by OpenAI's GPT-4o model to interpret
  your command, then discarded

You must explicitly tap the microphone button to start recording. Recording never
happens automatically or without your action.

1.4 Work Hours Data
The App stores your daily work hours, including:
- Entry and exit times
- Break duration
- Associated job site name and location
- Source (manual entry, geofence, or voice command)

1.5 Crash Reports and Diagnostics
We use Sentry (https://sentry.io) for crash reporting. When the App encounters an
error, the following may be sent to Sentry:
- Error messages and stack traces
- Device type, operating system version, and app version
- Anonymized usage context (no email addresses or precise coordinates)

This data helps us identify and fix bugs. You cannot opt out of crash reporting at
this time, but no personally identifiable information is included.

1.6 Device Information
We may collect basic device information (device model, OS version, app version) for
compatibility and debugging purposes.

2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

We use collected information exclusively for:
- Providing the time-tracking and geofencing service
- Processing voice commands

We do NOT use your information for:
- Advertising or marketing to third parties
- Selling or renting to data brokers
- Profiling or behavioral tracking
- Any purpose unrelated to the App's core functionality
